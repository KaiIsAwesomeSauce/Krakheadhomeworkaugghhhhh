        <h1>Deep Dive Into The Kraken</h1>
        <br>
    <div class="main">
        <h2>History</h2>

            <p>Tales of the Kraken can be traced back to ancient Scandinavian folklore, where it was featured in Nordic sagas and old sailor tales. Back then, the Kraken was described as a horrifying creature, with its features being exaggerated, no different than how people describe it today.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The earliest known sighting of the Kraken dates back to a manuscript made in 1180 by King Sverre of Norway. He claimed to have encountered the creature while on a voyage across the sea. He described the creature as being so large that it could easily be confused for an island.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Ever since King Sverre's eyewitness account, countless more sailors came out to talk about their encounters with the Kraken. As more stories were told and general details like its name, appearance, and size varied, the creature began to evolve so drastically that one would question if people were even describing the same thing. The only characteristic the Kraken kept among these stories was its violent habit of terrorizing ships and drowning sailors.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Here’s an example of how varied and even strange these descriptions could get: in 1700, Francesco Negri wrote an Italian travelogue, discussing his encounter with the Kraken. He described it as a colossal fish with a great number of horns and multiple arms protruding from its body.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Here’s another example. The Kraken appears in Erik Pontoppidans work Det første Forsøg paa Norges naturlige Historie (translated to The Natural History of Norway), where he claimed the creature to possess multiple limbs and had a crab- or starfish-like appearance.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Though, despite all of its varying appearances throughout multiple stories, the Kraken is most commonly portrayed as a large octopus/squid. Why is that?
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            French artist and naturalist Pierre Denys de Montfort could be the one credited for the popular depiction of the creature.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            In his book on the natural history of mollusks, he suggested that the creature Norwegian sailors claimed to have encountered was not a giant sea beast with a lust for blood but instead, a giant octopus.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            He was also the one who drew the well-known painting “colossal octopus,” depicting what’s presumably the kraken reeking havoc on a large ship while staring directly at the viewer.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The kraken’s evolution into a large octopus may also be attributed to the increase of encounters with giant squids during the eighteenth century.</p>
