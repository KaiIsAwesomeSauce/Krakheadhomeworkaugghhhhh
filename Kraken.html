    <h1>Deep Dive Into The Kraken</h1>
    <br>

<div class="everything">

    <div class="main">
    <h2 id="h2">Welcome</h2>

    <p>For centuries, people have told stories about a colossal squid roaming the ocean depths, waiting for and attacking sailors who roam near its territory.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The kraken is probably one of the most well known and oldest cryptids in history, with sightings of it dating back to 1100 BC. According to the legends, the Kraken is an oversized creature, commonly depicted as an octopus or squid, that's highly aggressive and will wreck any ship it comes across. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        This website will be dedicated to thoroughly analyzing the creature of myths.
