        <h1>Deep Dive Into The Kraken</h1>
        <br>
    <div class="main">
        <h2>The Real kraken</h2>

            <p>Over the years, people began to theorize that the Kraken was not the mythical sea demon sailors described it as but instead the real species architeuthis dux, or its simpler English name, giant squid. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            However, the theory faced doubt due to the unrecorded nature of the creature and the fact that all eyewitness accounts came from sailors rather than actual scientists. People attempted to document the creature, but that proved to be an incredibly difficult task to do.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>In 2006, a female giant squid was caught on video after a group of Japanese researchers lured it towards their boat using bait. This was the first ever recording of an A. dux alive, but now scientists wanted a recording of it in its natural habitat.</p>
            <img src="../Images/Archie.webp" width="200">
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            An article named Deep Sea Research Part 1: Oceanographic Research Papers how the giant squid was able to avoid being recorded for so many years and goes in depth about how researchers managed to record it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Scientists needed to find a solution to this, and so they decided to create a new way of recording deep sea species. Due to the monochromatic visual systems many abyssal creatures have, scientists decided to lower the intensity of the lights they were using and swapped the bright white light for red lights. They also opted to use stationary recording platforms, ones that made less noise. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            They also decided that using a form of bait was necessary—live bait. Live bait was able to attract active predators, unlike dead bait that only attracts scavengers. Thus, Edith Widder decided to add lights that resembled the lights of a deep-sea scyphozoan, Atolla Wyvillei.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, after countless trials and errors, they managed to record the giant squid in its natural habitat. (Unfortunately, the date on when this was captured seems to vary across sources, but people seem to agree that this was caught in the late 2000s to the early 2010s.) They managed to do this by placing EITS (eyes in the sea) in different areas of the sea and also a lure crate full of sliced bonito and the E-jelly.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The camera managed to capture four videos of differing squid species, theorized to be Promachoteuthis sloani, Pholidoteuthis adami, and Architeuthis dux.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The video is shown here…</p>
            <video controls muted width="300">
                <source src="Squid.mp4">
            </video>
            <p>This is the fourth recording captured, depicting what the researchers presume to be an architeuthis dux swimming towards the bait before swiftly retreating before its full body was able to be seen.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, after countless years, people were able to see the actual kraken.</p>
