        <h1>Deep Dive Into The Kraken</h1>
        <br>
    <div class="main">
        <h2>Theories</h2>

            <p>It is no shock that a cryptid such as the kraken would be met with suspicion.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Theories circulated about the Kraken not being an all-powerful sea demon like the sailors of old claimed it to be, but instead natural occurrences or real-life species.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            A theory suggests that volcanic eruptions or underwater earthquakes caused pandemonium in the ocean. Due to the lack of the advanced technology and knowledge we have today about these natural phenomena, sailors back then must have mistook it for something fantastical, such as the Kraken. Or the tectonic activity temporarily moved sea creatures closer to the surface, causing people to freak out.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Another one says that what people actually encountered was the actual species, architeuthis dux, or the giant squid.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The kraken and the architeuthis dux share traits that match up with each other. Both creatures are incredibly massive, though the architeuthis dux seems to take a more realistic height, unlike the Kraken's exaggerated size. Unfortunately, scientists currently have yet to estimate the exact size of Architeuthis dux because most samples of it come from species washed up on beach floors, the water causing them to bloat. Though its height is estimated to be 60 feet or higher.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Interesting to note; there have rarely been any accounts of the architeuthis dux acting hostile towards humans, let alone attacking them.
