        <h1>Deep Dive Into The Kraken</h1>
        <br>
    <div class="main">
        <h2>Pop Culture</h2>

            <p>It's no surprise that a creature as grand as the Kraken appeared in multiple types of media throughout the years. Its appearances range from comics, movies, TV shows, and poetry.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            In 1830, Alfred Tennyson wrote his poem The Kraken. The poem depicts the kraken as a figure veiled in mystery. It also says that there will be a day where humans inevitably discover its existence, and on that day the kraken will perish.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            This poem was what inspired one of, if not the most well known cosmic horror story, the call of cthulhu.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            While it's not a direct interpretation of the kraken, it clearly takes heavy inspiration from it. Both the kraken and cthulhu share similar traits, such as being large squid/octopus that are depicted as great beings with almost godlike strength, and both are able to instill fear in people.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Clash of the Titans was released in 1981, and the movie featured who else but the Kraken. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            It's noteworthy that Clash of the Titans decided to take on a different approach when designing the Kraken. The beast takes on a more humanoid appearance in the film; instead of being an octopus or squid as most recognize it as, the kraken now resembles a serpent or even a sea dragon.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite the creature’s brief appearances, it managed to have a massive impact on how the media portrayed the sea giant. Ever since Clash of the Titans came out, people have begun to associate the kraken with ancient Greece due to the movie settings and inspiration from the culture.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Interesting to notice that despite there being many sea monsters from ancient Greek mythology, none of them seem to resemble the kraken from clash of the titans.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The kraken also makes an appearance in a roller coaster in SeaWorld Orlando, which also happens to be named after it.
